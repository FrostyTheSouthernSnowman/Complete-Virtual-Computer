# Arithmetic and Logic Unit
This Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) was built from two Ben Eater videos. The 16-bit adder was built using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJc9CZcvBc) while the rest of the ALU was built using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOVOS9AjgFs&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=15). Thank you so much to Ben Eater for these fantastic videos!
