# Build Your Own Virtual Computer from the Ground, Up

## Build everything from transistors and boot loaders to operating systems in this virtual chip.

I have always wanted to understand how computers work. Unfortunately, building a computer with breadboards is expensive and time consuming. Why not build every part of a computer using just code? So much of this project was made thanks to [Ben Eaters YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS0N5baNlQWJCUrhCEo8WlA). I learned a lot about transistors, logic gates, and chip design from him.
